# LMM-GLMM
## Winter - 2021

This repository is a centralised web-ressource developped by members of the GRECA (Groupe de Recherche en Écologie Comportementale et Animale) at Université du Québec à Montréal. It is developped to provide tools for scientists who wish to compute linear (LMM) and generalised (GLMM) linear mixed models within an evolutionary behavioural ecology framework.

You will find different scripts (mostly R scripts) showcasing how to properly perform, analyse, and interpret (G)LMMs.

We provide a simulated dataset to perform all analyses which can be found in this repository https://github.com/GRECA-UQAM/LMM-GLMM. You may use the scripts and adapt them to your data / specific questions.
